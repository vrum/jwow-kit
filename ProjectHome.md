Java source code to read Blizzard's World of Warcraft (WoW) data files (BLP, DBC, etc.)

All BLP formats (DXT1, DXT3, DXT5) are currently supported and includes both BLP2PNG and BLP2CUR utility.

BLP2PNG will convert the BLP file into a PNG file readable by just about anything.

BLP2CUR will convert the BLP file into a CUR (Mouse cursor) file for Windows Vista and Windows 7 operating systems. In other words, if you wanted to use WoW's mouse cursors as your Windows cursor this will do the trick for you.
